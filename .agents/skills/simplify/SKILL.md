name: simplify
description: Review an implementation for bloat, unnecessary complexity, and unclear flow, then narrow it to core functionality with concise, newcomer-friendly structure. Use when the user asks to simplify code, reduce over-engineering, remove indirection, trim non-essential logic, or make an implementation easier to understand for someone unfamiliar with the codebase.

# simplify

## Workflow

1. Read the implementation end to end and identify the minimum required behavior.
2. Identify non-essential branches, abstractions, and indirection that do not serve the core behavior.
3. Identify duplicated logic, speculative flexibility, and configuration surface that can be removed.
4. Evaluate whether control flow and naming are immediately understandable to a new contributor.
5. Prioritize simplifications that preserve behavior while reducing moving parts and code volume.

## Findings Format

1. List simplification findings along with their severity score, highest first.
2. Include file paths and precise locations.
3. Explain why each area adds bloat or confusion.
4. Suggest a direct, minimal rewrite direction for each issue.
5. State explicitly when the implementation is already concise at the core.
